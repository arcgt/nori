        <h2 class="mb-4">Final Project Report - Purrfect Timing</h2>

        <p>The following report documents the features that I have implemented for my final project of the course Computer Graphics. The given theme this year is "Perfect Timing".</p>

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>There is so much happening around us everyday, all seemingly completely random, affected by so many random variables. But, sometimes, almost as if we were in a film, there are things that seem to happen with the perfect timing. My composition wishes to convey a chance encounter, seemingly an act of fate, that leads to the start of a new relation. This is represented by two felines that happen to cross each others' paths admist a busy world, capturing the moment where their tails intertwine to form the shape of a heart in a moment of stillness. Whether it be timing, angle, or focus, this chance encounter requires an absolutely... Purrfect timing.</p>

        <p>My proposed motivational image is composed of two parts: a background and a foreground. The background is a street, wet from a recent rainfall, and has many lights reflected from the wet surfaces in the scene. The foreground contains two cats, who walk by the middle of the street with a perfect timing such that their tails intertwine to form the shape of a heart. The background, together with the foreground, aim to set up an atmosphere of refreshing calm admist a busy world, a moment where despite the busyness, time stops for a moment. Below shows a few examples of what the background and foreground could look like.</p>

        <p><b>Background:</b></p>

          <img src="images/proposal/street.jpg" height="200">

          <img src="images/proposal/street4.jpg" height="200">
          <!-- <img src="images/proposal/street5.png" height="200"> -->
        </div><br>

        <p><b>Foreground:</b></p>
        <div>
          <img src="images/proposal/cattail2.jpg" height="200">
          <img src="images/proposal/cattail3.jpg" height="200">
          <img src="images/proposal/cattail.png" height="200">
        </div><br>

        <h4>Features</h4>
        <p>The following list describes the features I would like to implement: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple extra emitter (5 pts) - Create a spotlight for lampposts in the streets. Validation via comparison with the Mitsuba implementation of the spotlight.</li>
          <li>Layered BSDF (15 pts) - Rain on cement, to allow reflective lights on the ground. Validation via comparison with the Mitsuba implementation of internal scattering (under plastic BSDF).</li>
          <li>Fur Rendering (40 pts) - Render the fur of the cats in my scene. A full model includes curve primitives, an acceleration structure like BVH or KD-Tree, and Marschner hair BSDF. Validation will be done by comparing the rendered image with the implementation on a mature renderer like PBRT or Maya.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I will also need to use Blender to modify and piece together available meshes according to the scene I described above.</p>
