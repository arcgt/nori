        <p>The image I have rendered for my final submission can be observed above. Of the features I have implemented for my final project, I have used the spotlight for all the lamppost emitters in the scene, the Torrance-Sparrow BSDF for the lamppost mesh (for a more metallic texture), and the layered BSDF (composed of a dielectric coating on an Oren-Nayar diffuse surface) to create the effect of a wet, rain-covered street.</p>
        <p>I decided to keep my final render black and white as I felt this gave the image a more clean and still feeling, which better suits the effect I wished to convey from my motivation - a refreshing calm admist a busy world, a moment where despite the busyness, time stops for a moment.</p>
        <p>Although I did not complete my implementation of the fur rendering (which I will likely go back to complete when I have more time), I feel that I learnt a lot from this project. Having approached the Computer Graphics world for the first time this semester, I feel like everything took me extra time to get used to and adjust (including learning how to use Blender, external renderers such as Mitsuba, and using C++ for the first time), but I found the learning process very interesting and definitely useful for future applications, and am very happy with my final rendered image. My result was similar to the effect I wanted to convey in my motivation, with many reflective lights on a recently rained on ground, and two cats that coincidentally cross paths with the perfect timing.</p>
